Strings are a series of characters. They can be single words, multiple words, or special characters. All strings are written out between double quotes.

## Declaring Strings

```java
String str = "hello";
```

In the example above, `str` is the name of the string and it has a value of "hello". Remember to capitalize String, as it is a class, rather than a primitive data type.

## String Concatenations

When you are adding two strings together, you are concatenating them. The + ( plus ) operator combines two strings.

```java
String str1 = "hello";
String str2 = "world";
System.out.println(str1 + str2);
// returns "helloworld"
```

## String Index Numbers

The characters in a string are identified by index numbers. Index numbers start counting at 0.

| H   | E   | L   | L   | O   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |

## Useful String Methods

| Method            | Returns                                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| startsWith("a")   | String                                                    |
| endsWith(“a”)     | Boolean                                                   |
| length()          | int: the length of the string ( number of characters )    |
| indexOf(“a”)      | int: the index of the first position where “a” is located |
| replace(“a”, “b”) | String                                                    |
| toUpperCase()     | String                                                    |
| toLowerCase()     | String                                                    |
| trim()            | String                                                    |

Strings are immutable, which means once we initialize them, their value cannot be
changed. All methods that modify a string (like toUpperCase) return a new string
object. The original string remains unaffected.
