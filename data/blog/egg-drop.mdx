There is a building of 100 floors. If an egg drops from the Nth floor or above, it will break. If it’s dropped from any floor below, it will not break. You’re given 2 eggs. What strategy should you use to find $N$, while minimizing the number of drops for the worst case?

Bonus: If there are $K$ floors and $X$ eggs, what is your strategy to find $N$?
